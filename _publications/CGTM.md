Topic modeling is a powerful unsupervised tool for knowledge discovery. However, existing work struggles with generating limited-quality topics that are uninformative and incoherent, which hindering interpretable insights from managing textual data. In this paper, we improve the original variational autoencoder framework by incorporating contextual and graph information to address the above issues. First, the encoder utilizes topic fusion techniques to combine contextual and bag-of-words information well, and meanwhile exploits the constraints of topic alignment and topic sharpening to generate informative topics. Second, we develop a simple word co-occurrence graph information fusion strategy that efficiently increases topic coherence. On three benchmark datasets, our new framework generates more coherent and diverse topics compared to various baselines, and achieves strong performance on both automatic and manual evaluations.
