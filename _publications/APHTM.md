In this paper, we propose a neural hierarchical topic model AP-HTM based on anchor words. Unlike the popular prior models, our approach adds the concept of anchor words to the text generation process. We obtain the anchor space by clustering and propose three causal paths guided by anchor words to extend the VAE framework. In addition, we introduce a novel anchor-based contrastive learning to decouple the roles of anchor words in the paths, thus endowing the model with stronger anchor word and topic representation. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in extracting coherent, unique, and rationally structured topics.
