We presented HopWeaver, a fully automatic framework for synthesizing authentic multi-hop questions (bridge and comparison) from raw text corpora. Our experiments demonstrate that HopWeaver meets or exceeds human-level benchmarks across multiple evaluation dimensions and scales effectively with various LLMs. These capabilities make HopWeaver a practical solution for constructing complex MHQA datasets in domains where human annotation is limited. Our comprehensive evaluation system also provides valuable metrics for evaluating synthesized question quality, reducing cost compared to manual annotation.
