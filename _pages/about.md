I am a Master's student in the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://cse.sysu.edu.cn/) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). I am part of the research group led by Associate Professor [Yanghui Rao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dzO8p-0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree from the [Software College](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/) at [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/), where I was affiliated with the research group of Distinguished Professor [Yongshun Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YNE_32AAAAAJ&hl=en), a "Qilu Young Scholar". I was recommended for postgraduate studies (exemption from examination) based on my academic performance, ranking in the top 8% (24/300).

My research interests include text knowledge mining, topic models, and LLM applications.

## Education
*   **M.S. in Computer Science and Technology**, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China (2023.9 - 2026.6, expected)
    *   GPA: 84.1/100
*   **B.E. in Artificial Intelligence**, Shandong University, Jinan, China (2019.9 - 2023.6)
    *   GPA: 91.56/100

## Research Work
*   **GeM: Gaussian embeddings with Multi-hop graph transfer for next POI recommendation**
    *   Wenqian Mu\*, **Jiyuan Liu**\*, Yongshun Gong, et al. (\*equal contribution)
    *   *Neural Networks* (2025, CCF B, JCR Q1, journal full paper)
    *   This work proposes the GeM model to address challenges in POI recommendation, specifically concerning users' long- and short-term interests and behavioral uncertainty. By combining Gaussian embeddings and multi-hop graph transfer, GeM captures complex user interests and patterns for more accurate predictions.

*   **Unsupervised Hierarchical Topic Modeling via Anchor Word Clustering and Path Guidance**
    *   **Jiyuan Liu**, Hegang Chen, Chunjiang Zhu, et al.
    *   *Findings of EMNLP 2024* (CCF B, full paper)
    *   This paper introduces the AP-HTM model to tackle issues of low topic quality and unclear structure in existing Hierarchical Topic Models (HTMs). The framework improves topic coherence and diversity by unsupervisedly detecting anchor words and guiding the text generation process within a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework.

## Selected Awards & Honors
*   Second-class Academic Scholarship, School of Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, 2023
*   Outstanding Graduate, Shandong University Software College, 2023
*   Second-class Academic Scholarship/Cultural and Sports Scholarship, Shandong University Software College, 2021, 2022

## Professional Skills
*   Proficient in using PyTorch and LLM fine-tuning frameworks.
*   Good English reading and writing skills (CET-4: 602, CET-6: 491).
